# Analysis of the Swedish stock market with the help of K-means clustering
This project was created for my master thesis. I have combined many different tutorials to achieve the goal of this project but the main inspiration was the blog post of [Timothy Ong](https://medium.com/uptick-blog/stock-picks-using-k-means-clustering-4330c6c4e8de).

## What I have learned on this project

The main goal of this project was to have some hands-on unsupervised learning. My previous project was a forecast of the Swedish stock market using supervised learning (deep neural network - LSTM), so I wanted to learn more about unsupervised learning. During this project I obtained more knowledge about using the Yahoo Finance API directly from Python to download data from the stock market, I learned the strengths and weaknesses of the k-means method and unsupervised learning.

## What could be better
Since I was working part-time, taking care of a small child and writing my thesis at the same time, I did not had the time to get a clean code or a clean folder. I am hoping to someday get back to this code someday and clean it, meaning that I should write more comments in the main code and check which codes are relevant to my result. For now, I will just post all my files and folders to the github :).
